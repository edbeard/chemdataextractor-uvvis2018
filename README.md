# chemdataextractor-uvvis2018
ChemDataExtractor toolkit tailored towards UV/vis absorption spectroscopy peak data. This work adapts the underlying table extraction mechanics 
of [ChemDataExtractor version 1.3](http://www.chemdataextractor.org) , for higher precision extraction of maximum absorption peak wavelength data and associated extinction 
coefficients.
